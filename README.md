## Introduction

Compared to a majority of solutions, MarkdownView will render every component as **a native Xamarin.Forms view instead of via an HTML backend.** The Markdown is directly translated from a syntax tree to a hierarchy of Xamarin.Forms views; no HTML is being produced at all (hurray)!

This will produce a more reactive user interface, at the cost of rendering functionalities *(at the moment though!)*.

## Limitations

Unfortunately, Xamarin.Forms string rendering has some limitations...

- **Inlined images aren't supported** (*Xamarin.Forms formatted strings doesn't support inlined views*) : They will be displayed after the block they are referenced from.
- **Links are only clickable at a leaf block level**  (*Xamarin.Forms formatted strings doesn't support span user interactions*) : if a leaf block contains more than one link, the user is prompted. This is almost a feature since text may be too small to be enough precise! ;)
